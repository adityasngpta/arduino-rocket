Arduino Rocket is a water-powered rocket. It pressurizes a water-filled soda bottle at the launchpad, propelling the rocket upon release. The Arduino board is equipped with soldered altitude and accelerometer sensors, controls the rocket and deploys the parachute via a servo. This repo contains the rocket's C++ code.
